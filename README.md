# H4D-Student-Project---Authentication-Tests

# Overview
This will be a functional testing environment to compare the security, performance, time, and cost analysis.

# Objective Summary
In this application, there will be a functional website (local host 8080) that can traverse at the minima across 4 mediums; multi-factor, Oauth, RSA, and biometrics. When the user accesses the site. they will be greeted with an authenticator that is of a selected type. The user will then navigate using the selected authentication method (i.e. biometrics will require a finger print, and Oauth will require a microsoft login). These methods could test to see what is most convenient to the user. Once the user logs in, they will be greeted with a page that says “SUCCESS!” to indicate the success of the application.  Additionally, results will be measured by tracking computer metrics (such as CPU, throughput, and latency). On the application side, performance will be tracked as well, and quantified depending on the scalability of users. All results will be displayed in a chart.  The final step is security tests. The project will be sent to GitHub and downloaded as a local project, which will be sent to Ethan for red teaming operations. Ethan would test for spoofing attacks, using packet sniffers to collect PII, and, if possible, replay attacks.

# Conclusion
Overall, this MVP should demonstrate proofs on how biometrics is an ideal authentication method compared to the other 3 popular alternatives and ensure security and save time for Marine operations by eliminating the need for PIV cards and readers.
